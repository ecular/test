  - Fixed a bug where previous offset wasn't updated in the edge coverage

	Reported by Rodrigo Axel Monroy.

  - Changed the default coverage mode to basic block in order for the default
    configuration to work better with muti-threaded apps.

  - Added -no_follow_children to DR runtime flags. This can fix problems if the
    target process creates a child process.

  - More data in now written to the debug log
